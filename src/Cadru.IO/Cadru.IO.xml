            When using the asterisk wildcard character in a searchPattern (for

            When using the question mark wildcard character, this method returns

            The string returned by the ToString method represents path that was

            ToString method does not represent the fully qualified path. For
            example, when you create a FileInfo object using the GetFiles
            method, the ToString method does not represent the fully qualified path.

            <para>
            The FileVersionInfo properties are based on version resource
            information built into the file. Version resources are often built
            into binary files such as .exe or .dll files; text files do not have
            version resource information.
            </para>
            <para>
            Version resources are typically specified in a Win32 resource file,
            or in assembly attributes. The IsDebug property reflects the
            VS_FF_DEBUG flag value in the file's VS_FIXEDFILEINFO block, which
            is built from the VERSIONINFO resource in a Win32 resource file. For
            more information about specifying version resources in a Win32
            resource file, see the Platform SDK About Resource Files topic and
            VERSIONINFO Resource topic topics.

            The SetAccessControl method applies access control list (ACL)
            entries to the current file that represents the noninherited ACL list.
            </para>
            <para>
            Use the SetAccessControl method whenever you need to add or remove
            ACL entries from a file.
            </para>
            <para type="caution">
            The ACL specified for the fileSecurity parameter replaces the
            existing ACL for the file. To add permissions for a new user, use
            the GetAccessControl method to obtain the existing ACL, modify it,
            and then use SetAccessControl to apply it back to the file.
            </para>
            <para>
            An ACL describes individuals and/or groups who have, or do not have,
            rights to specific actions on the given file.
            </para>
            <para>
            The SetAccessControl method persists only FileSecurity objects that
            have been modified after object creation. If a FileSecurity object
            has not been modified, it will not be persisted to a file.
            Therefore, it is not possible to retrieve a FileSecurity object from
            one file and reapply the same object to another file.

            <remarks>
            The string returned by the ToString method represents path that was
            passed to the constructor. When you create a FileInfo object using
            the constructors, the ToString method returns the fully qualified
            path. However, there are cases where the string returned by the
            ToString method does not represent the fully qualified path. For
            example, when you create a FileInfo object using the GetFiles
            method, the ToString method does not represent the fully qualified path.
